# Prerequisites
These are things that will be beneficial to your user experience.

## Prefix Notice
Throughout this documentation, no prefix will be prepended to commands. However, when trying to run these commands, you will need to use your prefix. Our default prefix is the equal sign (`=`), but you may have configured your own.

## Aliases
We allow for the removal of the hyphen (`-`) from within all command names containing them. For example: `!staff-status-roles` is also callable as `!staffstatusroles`. Other aliases will be declared on the commandâ€™s page.
