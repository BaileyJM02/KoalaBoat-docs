# Prerequisites
These are things that will be beneficial to your user experience.

## Usage Information
Within these docs, you will find text such as `<phrase>` and `[user]` throughout.
- Arguments within `<` and `>` are **mandatory**, therefor, if a command contains `<phrase>`, the phrase argument is needed. If this is not included, the command will fail or you will have a undesirable outcome.
- Arguments within `[` and `]` are **optional**, therefor, if a command contains `[user]`, the user argument is not needed. If this is not included, the command will run as normal.
- Arguments containing a pipe (`|`) mean that you can input either one of these options here. For example, if we had `[ban | kick | mute]` we could put **either** ban, kick or mute but no more than one.

## Prefix Notice
Throughout this documentation, no prefix will be prepended to commands. However, when trying to run these commands, you will need to use your prefix. Our default prefix is the equal sign (`=`), but you may have configured your own.

## Aliases
We allow for the removal of the hyphen (`-`) from within all command names containing them. For example: `!staff-status-roles` is also callable as `!staffstatusroles`. Other aliases will be declared on the commandâ€™s page.
