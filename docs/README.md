# Welcome {docsify-ignore-all}

KoalaBoat is a multi purpose Discord bot with an array of commands and settings to make it just right for you. This documentation should cover all basic usage along with some extra information for the more tricker commands to master.

This documentation is open-source, please read the [contributing page](/contributing.md) before you decide to contribute if you do.

I personally recommend you read the [prerequisites](/prerequisites.md) before you go any further as it offers a quick overview of key features and contains information useful regarding the documentation to make them more understandable.
